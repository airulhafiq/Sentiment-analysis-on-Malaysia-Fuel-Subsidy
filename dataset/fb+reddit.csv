There’s always ways to determine whether the user is eligible and part of B40, it’s not fool proof, and there’ll always be some leakages, but it’ll help those deserving cases. Another suggestion is if the owner is qualified. A filial child decides to buy his retired father say a Toyota. The car is still in the child’s name. He cannot afford fill up with Ron 97 if ownership is used on eligibility. That is most unfair to the retiree as his child is probably in a higher category.

That means these groups of young adults will not be entitled to the subsidised petrol because of the models of vehicles? Being some of the retirees, they also would like to enjoy their retirement by driving their dream vehicles then again their model of vehicles may not be entitled to as well? As a learned person, professor you should have better thoughts than many of us.

Vincent Ang,Timothy See ThoeYes. Subsidy should be based on how much you consume of the subsidy.,Neutral
Timothy See Thoe,"Vincent Ang based on your logic, PHEV cars should be entitled for subsidized fuel.",Positive
Vincent Ang,Timothy See ThoeYes. All ICE cars in Malaysia are already heavily taxed. The more expensive your car the higher the taxes. This should not be confused with subsidies for fuel. In general cars with large engine capacity are also not fuel efficient. If you choose a car with heavy fuel consumption then it is not fair to subsidise you.,Negative
Timothy See Thoe,Vincent Ang I thought subsidy is to help the poor but you seems to say that subsidies is to help the car owner that have cars with good fuel consumption.,Positive
Vincent Ang,"Timothy See ThoeYes but income is not the only criteria. Hanging on to big engined 20 year old car is being stubborn regardless of income. The fuel consumption of such cars are horrendous.  Subsidies are not for protecting your ego. Obviously if your reported income isf RM 130k a year you are rich. The government is using gross household income to define the T15. This is a dirty play by the government. RM 7k per person is not rich anywhere in Malaysia. Makan senang yes. Maha kaya no. Obviously as a percentage the Maha kaya makes up a very small proportion of our population. Moreover, these Maha kaya are given all sorts of allowances by the companies they control. The T15 criteria is a dirty way by the government to tax the middle class. Why not a 400% tax on luxury ICE cars. Increase the road tax on racing cars by 400% too. Believe me the rich would not even care. It is their Trust Funds and Companies which pay for them.",Positive
Chris Gooi,"Timothy See Thoe ihes an diot right. means this rich fellow is taking advantage of a  loophole in the system. It's ok the steal rm0.50 frequently, because you seem poor driving a kancil. His logic.",Positive
Vincent Ang,"Chris GooiWrong. Whether you are rich or poor has nothing to do with the subsidies you get. The question is the amount of subsidy your car burns. In Singapore road tax is calculated based on the amount of power the engine of your car generate. Do you need a 300 hp car which is a petrol sucker? Obviously you do not need to burn so much fuel to go from point A to point B. ""Your car being serviced ha. The shop lent you a myvi is it?  If you send your Porsche to Porsche Glenmarie for repairs they loan you a BMW. People like them would not even go near the cars driven by ordinary Malaysians. Another aspect is income level. I make RM130k a year but I register my vehicle as a Myvi. You think anyone would believe thus fellow needs a subsidy?",Positive
